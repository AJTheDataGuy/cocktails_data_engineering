# cocktails_data_engineering
Project to track drink prices at bars in Perth, Australia with a focus on cocktail pricing. This project first uses a web spider (refined from my business analyser repo to be object oriented) to grab the data, and then will use Django, Leaflet, and PostGIS to display the data in a small web app.
